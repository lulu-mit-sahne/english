### 3x2 a magazine series


The magazine series 3X2 portrays six people in different situations. In the episode "The Germans and the Fear"; we visit two young people in the middle of their formation, two in the middle of their lives and two whose lives are coming to an end. But one thing unites them all, they're all afraid. But are these different for people with different social or cultural backgrounds? Are there similarities, although the protagonists are fundamentally different? And can one thus infer a universal fear of the Germans? We ask these questions in this episode of 3X2.
