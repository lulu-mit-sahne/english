The black BMW made its way through the crowd. He first took the 202, turned off at the monument and headed for the small airport building. In the car: Radka, Zdravka and Ekatherina - the three clairvoyants. There was tension in the air. People flocked to the airport - on foot, by car, on donkey carts, Shtraklevo was ready to welcome the aliens.

Nikolai is a filmmaker, journalist and ex-husband of Zdravka - one of the three clairvoyants. Their sons were standing on the airfield together, they had brought flowers with them. "Why?";
"Because Mom said we're going to welcome aliens now."

The press waited - locally, nationally, print, radio, television. Everyone was there to spread the word and secure it for posterity. No one could have expected so many people to go to the airport.
The people pressed themselves against the wire fences, stared at the sky and waited. It was not yet so far, nor should it last more than an hour. At 11 o'clock eight spaceships were supposed to land at the airport and save Bulgaria's children. Shtraklevo waited spellbound for her arrival.
