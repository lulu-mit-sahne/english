### A reportage by Julius Schmitt

Loredana stares at her smartphone with glassy eyes. Sergiu and Elena smile. 
She gets her guitar and starts to play. Some 2,000 kilometers to the west, her parents sit in a small room near London and listen to the tunes of their child. Then they ask how she is. 

Sasha's cell phone rings - his mother is calling him from the Czech Republic. He answers - small talk - school was good. Daily routine in Sasha's life. He won't see his mother again for another five months. 

There are many like Sasha and Loredana in Moldova - about 20,000 children are affected. Nowhere are the effects of labor migration on children so drastic. Republic of Moldova - the country without parents.
