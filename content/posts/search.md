### A Documentary by Julius Schmitt

All the essentials in the bag: tools, clothing, working shoes - ready 24/7. 
Gerd Habel and his dog Jago volunteer as rescue specialists - together they search for lost people in Germany. 
A natural disaster can come at any time. With this thought in mind, Gerd trains for any emergency.
